# sftp-to-s3

Docker image which provides an SFTP access to a specified S3 bucket.

## Usage

Pull the image from docker hub repository 

    docker pull emmekappa/sftp-to-s3

Run the container with 
```sh
docker run \
	-e S3_IDENTITY=changeme \
	-e S3_CREDENTIAL=changeme \
	-e S3_BUCKET=changeme \
	--privileged \
	-p 222:22 \
	-d \
	brandfolder/sftp-to-s3 
```

You have to specify the AWS credentials via `S3_IDENTITY `and `S3_CREDENTIAL`.
You have also to specify the bucket to mount via `S3_BUCKET`).
 
Now you can try to login via `sftp` using the username specified as `$S3_IDENTITY` and the password as `$S3_CREDENTIAL`.
 
    $ sftp -P 222 changeme@127.0.0.1
    changeme@127.0.0.1's password:
    Connected to 127.0.0.1.
